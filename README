Installation

  Clone the git repository to download the files locally:

    git clone https://github.com/jpmontez/login.git

  Then navigate into the directory, and install the dependencies with `pip`:

    cd login/
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

  Optionally, set an alias within your ~/.bash_profile file for a shortcut:

    alias login='/path/to/login.py'

Configuration

  This script uses a simple INI file to set variables. The default path is
  `~/.core.cfg`, but another can be specified using the `--config` flag.

  Create the file and set it's permissions:

    touch ~/.core.cfg
    chmod 600 ~/.core.cfg

  Using your preferred editor, edit the file, add these lines, and replace the
  bastion, username, and password variables:

    [login]
    ohthree  = 'https://reports.ohthree.com'
    bastion  = BASTION_HOSTNAME
    username = SSO_USER
    password = SSO_PASS
    regions  = ORD, DFW, LON, SYD, IAD

  Now you're ready to use the script!
